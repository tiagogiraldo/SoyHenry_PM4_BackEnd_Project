# Ecommerce Back End Project with Nestjs

This ecommerce backend project uses NestJS to design and implement a robust and scalable API that handles a high volume of requests and provides a seamless user experience. The project follows a well-planned code architecture and uses a Postgres database with TypeORM for data management. It features API endpoints for CRUD operations, validation, pagination, and security measures such as encryption, JWT authentication, and role-based access control. Additionally, the project integrates with Cloudinary for cloud image management and generates documentation using Swagger and Open API. By implementing these features, the project aims to create a secure, efficient, and well-documented backend for an ecommerce application that can handle a large volume of users and transactions.

Project goals:

- Planning and defining the code architecture.
- Initializing Node projects.
- Basic configuration of a project.
- Creating and using NestJS repositories.
- Creating routes for processing requests corresponding to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of each entity.
- Creating a Postgres database.
- Validating the body of requests.
- Implementing pagination of results based on the information received in the route.
- Using guards for route protection.
- Creating a Postgresql database.
- Configuring and connecting with TypeORM.
- Creating and defining entities.
- Creating validations using Pipes to validate the information of requests.
- Connecting with Cloudinary for cloud image management.
- Uploading files to a Cloudinary session.
- Consuming images from Cloudinary.
- Implementing encryption and decryption of passwords.
- Signing and validating JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Using guards for authentication and route protection.
- Implementing role-based access control.
- Creating documentation for the application using Swagger and Open API.
